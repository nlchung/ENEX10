              <br>
              <br>Activities done:</span>
              <br>During this meeting, I asked Sarah about her job. We discussed the pros and cons of working from home, as well as what her role is at Shopify and her day to day schedule. After, we went over the ENEX documents and she asked about my interests, experiences, before we began to brainstorm possible project ideas.
              <br>
              <br><span class="bold">Approximate time spent on each activity:</span>
              <br>Talking about her job: 15 mins
              <br>Signing Documents & Discussing ENEX: 10 mins
              <br>
              <br><span class="bold">What I learned about my passion:</span>
              <br>In this meeting, I learned some more specifics about what working in web development might cover, and I learned that a lot of it includes stuff I might&#39;ve learned about data analytics last year for my ENEX 9. For example, Sarah brought up user data, and machine learning, and how she might see a bit of that doing what she does. This intrigued me as I hadn&#39;t figured that the two topics would relate so closely.
              <br>
              <br><span class="bold">What I learned about myself:</span>
              <br>In this meeting, I realized that there is a lot within web development, data science, machine learning and such that I&#39;d like to learn about, and that I have to learn to prioritize which things would be the most practical, and important to learn. Furthermore, I have a limited amount of time for ENEX, thus I will need to choose a few small topics to learn more about and settle with that. This made me realize that I am ambitious and very eager to learn more, however lack the time to do so.
              <br>
              <br><span class="bold">What I learned about the larger world:</span>
              <br>As I talked to Sarah about how she works from home for a business based across the country, I learned about how, with the way that technology has developed, working from home can be just about the same as working in an office with others. However, some differences include it being a bit harder to interact with others if there are questions and concerns, since you would have to schedule a call and such. Anyhow, it is much more convenient and simple to work from home, and could be a better working environment depending on your individual ideal working conditions. Having gone over the pros and cons with Sarah, I had the opportunity to reflect on which way I would work better with and if that might be a type of job that I could potentially want to acquire in the future.

            <br>Activities done:</span>
            <br>In this meeting, I met with my mentor at her house to take a look at her set up, go over the project proposal sheet and plan out my path from now until April. Then, she showed me some programs that we will be using for the process, as well as some that she works with in her daily work. We created an account and platform on GitHub, Cloud 9, and began to look at the freecodecamp tutorials. After that, we explored more within programs that she uses for her job, and tasks and routines she might run through on a typical work day. She also answered some questions that I had about web development and her job.
            <br>
            <br><span class="bold">Approximate time spent on each activity:</span>
            <br>Project Proposal: 5 mins
            <br>Exploring Programs: 15 mins
            <br>Exploring her Job: 25 mins
            <br>
            <br><span class="bold">What I learned about my passion:</span>
            <br>As Sarah showed me some programs and platforms she works with, I got to see how a lot of her work on this help site required learning more about the users and what they want. She demonstrated to me how she can watch how a user uses her site, and an example of an issue they might encounter through observing their behavior. This was quite interesting to me, since when web development is brought up, the main idea seems to be revolved around programming, but there&#39;s much more than that and I really enjoyed getting to see some of that.
            <br>
            <br><span class="bold">What I learned about myself:</span>
            <br>Due to the fact that I got to see a little bit of her daily routine and some work she does, I realized that I take interest in a lot of it, and was never bored of anything she was showing me. She showed me that a lot of her work involves machine learning, data collection, and analyzing data from users to improve the site. This is all incorporated into my ENEX 9 topic of data analytics, which I also take interest in. Thus, this meeting showed me that I do really enjoy a lot of what web development involves.
            <br>
            <br><span class="bold">What I learned about the larger world:</span>
            <br>I learned that in life, change is going to be consistent, and learning to adapt to that and realize who I am and what I want is vital. I learned a bit about this last year when my interviewees both told me about their changing career paths through university and even now, but I saw a bit more of this when Sarah was showing me how she wants to work more in UI UX, and how new programming languages and aspects are constantly developing and changing.

            <br>Activities done:</span>
            <br>In this meeting, Sarah and I went over my last two meeting logs which she signed, then we began to look at my progress so far which included the coding camp lessons I had completed and the sites that I had taken note of for inspiration. We then began to compile and organize our ideas to draw out my mockups for the design of the website.
            <br>
            <br><span class="bold">Approximate time spent on each activity:</span>
            <br>Signing Meeting Logs: 5 mins
            <br>Checking Progress: 10 mins
            <br>Compiling Ideas and Drawing Mockups: 1 hour
            <br>
            <br><span class="bold">What I learned about my passion:</span>
            <br>I found that creating the design for my page took a lot of brainstorming and taking inspiration from other sites through research and note-taking on features I might want on my own site took a lot of time. Sarah really helped to guide me, and put my ideas into mockups, which was the most difficult thing I had encountered so far in the project, since I had no idea where to start. This made me realize how much of this project relies on creativity and being able to compile your ideas together.
            <br>
            <br><span class="bold">What I learned about myself:</span>
            <br>In creating the mockups, I began to realize that I am not very creative and struggle to come up with new ideas and designs, however I often find features on sites that I love and found that I was easily able to compile lots of inspiration sites. 
            <br>
            <br><span class="bold">What I learned about the larger world:</span>
            <br>In this stage of my project, I learned about how taking that first step to get something started can often be quite difficult, and possibly the hardest thing to overcome when encountering a lack of ideas. Procrastination by doing other tasks began to negatively impact my work ethic on the project, and it wasn&#39;t until I met with Sarah that we were able to get something started with her help. This made me realize how difficult it would be to work in a field with creative design since I often lack ideas and struggle to be creative.

          <br>Activities done:</span>
          <br>In this meeting, Sarah and I decided that we would start working on the framework of the site in HTML. We worked collaboratively at her house on her computer using Cloud 9, whilst having my Photoshop mockup pulled up on my own laptop. Sarah guided me and taught me how to properly format the HTML sheet, as well as which tags to use and why.
          <br>
          <br><span class="bold">Approximate time spent on each activity:</span>
          <br>Discussing Progress Since Last Meeting: 5 mins
          <br>Creating HTML Page: 40 mins
          <br>
          <br><span class="bold">What I learned about my passion:</span>
          <br>I learned that there are several stages to this process, including lots of design stages. Having completed a sketch, then a Photoshop mockup, and now an HTML frame with absolutely no content, it almost felt as if we were taking steps backwards. Though I realized building websites often means taking steps backwards to move forward.
          <br>
          <br><span class="bold">What I learned about myself:</span>
          <br>I learned that I tend to learn better when seeing things done and trying them out. Having completed several HTML tutorials on freecodecamp.org, I did not completely comprehend the HTML formatting until Sarah showed me how to use which tags and when. 
          <br>
          <br><span class="bold">What I learned about the larger world:</span>
          <br>Throughout the project, I found that I was always a bit scared to bother Sarah and ask for help, since most of it seemed to be simple concepts, yet I could not completely grasp the concepts of the use of the different languages, the different tags in HTML, and what the point of each one is. This made me realize that in the real world, it is much harder to ask for help compared to what we currently experience in school. As you get older and are expected to know more, often it can be intimidating to admit that you don&#39;t understand and need help or guidance, but putting pride and fear aside to ask questions can often be what you need to succeed.

              <br>Activities done:</span>
              <br>In this meeting, Sarah and I began to work on the CSS. Having already built an HTML frame last meeting, Sarah began to teach me how to load programs into the head of the site, and operate bootframe. As well, we began to create my own CSS styles in a stylesheet to override designs in the bootstrap that didn&#39;t match what I wanted to create. We began to implement the CSS to match my site design.

              <br>
              <br><span class="bold">What I learned about my passion:</span>
              <br>This session with Sarah was where she really began to teach me more technical stuff due to the fact that we had begun to work with both HTML and CSS, and she was able to elaborate to me about bootstrap and other strategies that developers might use to build a site. This also was the first session where we started to actually put something together that resembled my design with code. This was really interesting to take part in and watch it slowly come together. It made me realize that the lengthy work of finding inspiration and planning was paying off to be pretty interesting.
              <br>
              <br><span class="bold">What I learned about myself:</span>
              <br>This realization of the fact that I enjoyed the coding much more than I did trying to piece together the design made me consider the fact that I enjoyed coding and that design was not really for me.
              <br>
              <br><span class="bold">What I learned about the larger world:</span>
              <br>This meeting showed me how behind every little thing on the internet, there is so much more going on, and so much planning that goes into it. It also showed me the different tips and tricks that people might use, and made me realize that some small things on sites that I thought were really simple were actually quite complex, and other things that appeared complex could really be quite simple.

              <br>Based on the first HTML layout of the site that we had created, we began to input more of the features I had imagined on my site using semantic UI, and spent a while debugging & problem solving for issues we came across with the CSS.

              <br><span class="bold">What I learned about my passion:</span>
              <br>As we worked on the site and implemented more features, I realized how important spacing can be. This stage of the project was where I began to struggle a little more with reading through our code, since each feature would have several divs, and the spacing was crucial to see which divs ended where.
              <br>
              <br><span class="bold">What I learned about myself:</span>
              <br>As we began inputting more of the features that I wanted in my site, I knew that I had never been very creative, and I found that I struggled a lot with figuring out how I wanted my site to look. Things like spacing preferences or photos were what I struggled with, and often would be very indecisive when deciding what to put on the site. The design and flow of my site were what I struggled with most this whole project.
              <br>
              <br><span class="bold">What I learned about the larger world:</span>
              <br>Going from my Photoshop version of the mockup to building this site from scratch felt like we were taking steps backwards. This was because my Photoshop design had been fairly organized, and this rough copy of the code was very incomplete. It made it look like my site had been lacking everything that we needed. This almost felt counterproductive to start from scratch and build it up, but made me realize that sometimes you need to go backwards a bit to continue moving forward.

              <br><span class="bold">Activities done:</span>
              <br>Now that we had a basic setup of most features, we started to make these features resemble my original site a bit more & and debug. Our main goals from here on were to make the site function smoothly, to incorporate all the functions I wanted it to, and debug.
              <br>
              <br><span class="bold">Approximate time spent on each activity:</span>
              <br>Editing the site and debugging: 1.5 Hours
              <br>
              <br><span class="bold">What I learned about my passion:</span>
              <br>I learned from this session that debugging can be very tedious and time-consuming. within this session, most of our time was spent trying to figure out why some functions would not work as expected, or would not run at all, and figure out where it went wrong. This could be anything from missing a bracket, or the C9 site just glitching. This turned out to be very difficult for us to work with, and made it harder for me to work on the site in my own time, since I don&#39;t have as much experience to be able to find the source of the bugs as easily.
              <br>
              <br><span class="bold">What I learned about myself:</span>
              <br>I felt that in this session, I was quite impatient. It felt like we weren&#39;t making much progress, since we had to spend so much time playing around with different parts to find the bugs, and make our site work. In addition, we weren&#39;t able to get through the whole site in this session and had to schedule another session to continue debugging and filling in the holes in my site. This felt frustrating and made me a little upset with the fact that things weren&#39;t going as planned, and had to be delayed so much.
              <br>
              <br><span class="bold">What I learned about the larger world:</span>
              <br>Struggling to fix these issues taught me that it takes time to achieve greatness, and that perfection isn&#39;t possible. Things won&#39;t always go as planned, and to be happy or have success, it is important to be adaptable and be able to change your goals. My expectations of my final project throughout this process had definitely changed and been adapted several times, and continues to change. I don&#39;t believe that this project is as perfect as it could be, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s what I expected it to be, but considering how much time and effort that Sarah and I put in to it, I&#39;d say I&#39;m very happy to see where it is now, and that the way that I can say that is because I was able to be reasonable with my expectations for myself.

            <br>
            <br><span class="bold">Activities done:</span>
            <br>This session was simply finishing up the site, fixing small bugs, adjusting the spacing between containers, and filling in content to make sure the site looked okay.

            <br><span class="bold">Approximate time spent on each activity:</span>

            <br>
            <br><span class="bold">What I learned about my passion:</span>
            <br>I learnt at this stage that a lot of the little things that I wanted to fix or change could actually take a lot of time to do. This was due to bugs that we couldn&#39;t track down, or the fact that changing one thing, would mean that we have to change several other things to adapt to this. It meant overall very time-consuming tasks, with little reward to them. However, after managing to fix enough of these bugs and issues we weren&#39;t happy with, we were left with a site that looked just about how we had wanted it.
            <br>
            <br><span class="bold">What I learned about myself:</span>
            <br>These issues throughout the project really taught me to be patient with issues, and not expect things to go well on the first try. As well, this meeting happened during a time where I was very busy with several different events and assignments, so I had to think more about prioritizing tasks in a way that would assure I could complete everything in time. This proved to be my biggest struggle, and showed me that trying to complete tasks as large as ENEX at the last minute is very stressful.
            <br>
            <br><span class="bold">What I learned about the larger world:</span>
            <br>As mentioned above, I learned about how little changes can have big effects. I think this is also reflective to anything that happens in the real world. Small solutions can have bigger effects, and possibly cause more issues before it can all be solved. The key to this is to be patient and get through one task at a time. This was quite hard for me to figure out and adapt to, since it seemed like I had so many issues that I wanted to deal with all at once.

## Enrichment Explorations (ENEX)
This project is associated with Steveston London Secondary's enriched program. ENEX serves as a three-year opportunity to explore topics of interest.
For my grade 10 final project, I pursued a mentorship under Shopify's [Sarah Veness](http://www.sarahveness.com/), an experienced web developer and mentor. Following her guidance of best practice and resources, I learned to navigate the process of taking a hand-drawn mockup to a deployed web page using HTML, CSS, bootstrap, and Git.
